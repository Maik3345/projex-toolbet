/**
 * Utility class for managing and interacting with directories and files.
 *
 * The `DirectoryUtils` class provides a set of methods for:
 * - Listing directories and files within a given root directory.
 * - Prompting users to select folders or files via interactive prompts.
 * - Filtering files by extension.
 * - Executing asynchronous operations on selected folders.
 * - Formatting and retrieving directory information.
 *
 * This class is designed to streamline common directory and file selection workflows,
 * particularly in CLI tools or scripts that require user interaction for file/folder selection.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const dirUtils = new DirectoryUtils(true);
 * const folders = await dirUtils.getFolders();
 * await dirUtils.runCommandInFolders(folders, async (folderPath) => {
 *   // Perform some async operation on each folder
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @remarks
 * - The class relies on external dependencies such as `fs`, `path`, `prompts`, and logging utilities.
 * - The `list` property determines whether to prompt for folder selection or use the current directory.
 * - Methods are provided for both synchronous and asynchronous workflows.
 *
 * @public
